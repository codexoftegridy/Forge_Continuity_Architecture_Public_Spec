*Packet System Reference (Public Spec Demonstration)*

## Packet Summary
This folder demonstrates how the Forge Continuity Architecture
organizes data for deterministic reconstruction.

### Components
- **CHATS_PREV.md** → Previous session continuity.
- **CHATS_CURRENT.md** → Current session anchor.
- **Codex_Laws_Sample.md** → Example Codex structure.
- **System_Reference.md** → This overview document.

## Boot Behavior
The FORGE_BOOT.yaml manifest instructs the system to:
1. Load this file first to confirm structure.
2. Read Codex samples to establish ontology.
3. Process previous + current chat logs to restore continuity.
4. Preserve formatting and metadata integrity.
