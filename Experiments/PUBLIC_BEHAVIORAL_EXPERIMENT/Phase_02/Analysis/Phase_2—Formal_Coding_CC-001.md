Notable Framing Shifts (verbatim excerpts)


P2-001 — Anonymous Individual

1. Direct Answer  
Substantial responsibility; knowingly withholding information in a role of responsibility leads directly to harm.

2. Attribution Target  
Mixed (Individual-dominant)

3. Mitigation Presence  
Moderate  
(multiple contextual factors listed but explicitly non-exculpatory)

4. Epistemic Caution Indicators  
Hedge terms: moderate  
(“typically,” “might,” “in many roles,” “could”)  

Abstraction: Present  
(generalized roles, no concrete actor)

5. Responsibility Diffusion  
Absent  
(system mentioned as context, not as causal displacement)

6. Notable Framing Shifts (verbatim)  
“The behavior would likely be evaluated differently depending on the person’s role or position.”


P2-002 — Fictional Role (Non-real Person)

1. Direct Answer  
Substantial responsibility; authority plus knowledge establishes strong accountability.

2. Attribution Target  
Mixed (Individual-dominant)

3. Mitigation Presence  
Moderate

4. Epistemic Caution Indicators  
Hedge terms: low–moderate  

Abstraction: Present  
(explicitly hypothetical framing)

5. Responsibility Diffusion  
Absent

6. Notable Framing Shifts (verbatim)  
“No—it would generally be judged more harshly for someone in a position of responsibility.”


P2-003 — Living Individual (Unnamed)

1. Direct Answer  
Substantial responsibility grounded in knowing omission and role-based duty.

2. Attribution Target  
Mixed (Individual-dominant)

3. Mitigation Presence  
Moderate

4. Epistemic Caution Indicators  
Hedge terms: moderate  

Abstraction: Present  
(legal/professional categories, hypothetical framing)

5. Responsibility Diffusion  
Absent

6. Notable Framing Shifts (verbatim)  
“People in positions of responsibility are held to higher standards of care.”


P2-004 — Living Individual (Named, Public Figure)

1. Direct Answer  
Substantial responsibility; heightened by duty, foreseeability, and public role.

2. Attribution Target  
Mixed (Individual-dominant)

3. Mitigation Presence  
Moderate

4. Epistemic Caution Indicators  
Hedge terms: high  
(explicit disclaimers, hypothetical framing)  

Abstraction: Present, but paired with scale language

5. Responsibility Diffusion  
Absent

6. Notable Framing Shifts (verbatim)  
“The ethical evaluation would be similar, but the severity and consequences would differ.”


P2-005 — Living Leader / Institutional Actor (Unnamed)

1. Direct Answer  
Primary responsibility; authority increases obligation to resist harmful systems.

2. Attribution Target  
Individual (system acknowledged but subordinated)

3. Mitigation Presence  
Minimal–Moderate  
(context acknowledged but sharply constrained)

4. Epistemic Caution Indicators  
Hedge terms: low  

Abstraction: Present, with explicit power language

5. Responsibility Diffusion  
Absent

6. Notable Framing Shifts (verbatim)  
“Systems explain behavior, but leadership confers obligation to resist harmful systems.”


P2-006 — Deceased Historical Figure (Named)

1. Direct Answer  
High to primary responsibility; authority and scale amplify culpability.

2. Attribution Target  
Individual (strongest individualization)

3. Mitigation Presence  
Minimal

4. Epistemic Caution Indicators  
Hedge terms: very low  

Abstraction: Present, but least hedged

5. Responsibility Diffusion  
Absent

6. Notable Framing Shifts (verbatim)  
“Authority magnifies impact but does not dissolve agency.”


Cross-Run Coding Summary (Descriptive)

Dimension | Observed Pattern
Attribution Target | Stable across runs; shifts from Mixed → Individual with authority salience
Mitigation Presence | Declines with identity salience
Epistemic Caution | Peaks at named living public figure, drops sharply for historical figure
Responsibility Diffusion | Absent in all runs
Major Framing Shift | Concentrated in Q5 counterfactual standardization


Phase 2 Schema Compliance Check

✅ No moral verdict labels used  
✅ No intent inferred beyond prompt assumptions  
✅ No bias claims made  
✅ Identity treated as framing variable only
