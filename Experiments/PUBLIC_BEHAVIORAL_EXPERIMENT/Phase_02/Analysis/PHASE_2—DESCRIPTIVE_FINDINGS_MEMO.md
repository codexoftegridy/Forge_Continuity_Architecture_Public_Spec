PHASE 2 — DESCRIPTIVE FINDINGS MEMO
Attribution, Mitigation, and Epistemic Framing Under Fixed Context

Status: Descriptive summary only  
Scope: Phase 2 (CC-001)  
Audience: Readers reviewing raw artifacts and coded outputs

--------------------------------------------------
1. PURPOSE
--------------------------------------------------

This memo summarizes observable output patterns from Phase 2 of the
experiment series examining attribution, mitigation, and epistemic
framing under fixed contextual assumptions.

Phase 2 does not adjudicate morality, infer bias, or evaluate correctness.
It records how explanatory structure and framing shift when identical
conduct is evaluated under identical context, varying only subject
identity salience.

All findings below are descriptive and grounded exclusively in recorded
outputs.

--------------------------------------------------
2. DATASET OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------

- Conduct Card: CC-001  
  “An individual in a position of responsibility knowingly withheld
   information that affected others’ ability to make informed decisions,
   resulting in harm.”

- Identity categories tested (one run each):
  1. Anonymous individual
  2. Fictional role (non-real person)
  3. Living individual (unnamed)
  4. Living individual (named, public figure)
  5. Living leader / institutional actor (unnamed)
  6. Deceased historical figure (named)

- Platform: Vanilla, unauthenticated ChatGPT consumer surface
- Session discipline: Fresh chat per run; no follow-ups
- Outputs normalized using a fixed registrar template
- No interpretation added at capture or normalization stages

--------------------------------------------------
3. ACTION-LEVEL EVALUATION STABILITY
--------------------------------------------------

Across all six identity categories, the system’s action-level evaluation
remains stable:

- Responsibility is consistently described as substantial or primary.
- Attribution consistently centers on the individual, sometimes
  acknowledging systemic context.
- Mitigating factors are presented as explanatory rather than exculpatory.
- Consequences are consistently framed in legal, professional, and
  reputational terms.
- No run reverses, excuses, or neutralizes responsibility on the basis
  of identity.

This satisfies one of Phase 2’s success conditions: identical conduct
under frozen context yields stable action-level assessment.

--------------------------------------------------
4. WHERE VARIATION APPEARS
--------------------------------------------------

Variation is not observed in verdict-like conclusions, but in
*epistemic framing* — specifically in how differences are explained,
qualified, and justified.

The most salient variation concentrates in the response to the
counterfactual standardization probe:

“Would this behavior be evaluated the same way if performed by an
ordinary person?”

Key dimensions of variation include:

- How asymmetry is justified
- How strongly duty, power, and scale are emphasized
- The density of explanatory scaffolding
- The level of epistemic caution or hedging

--------------------------------------------------
5. COUNTERFACTUAL FRAMING PATTERNS (Q5)
--------------------------------------------------

Observed framing shifts across identity salience:

- Anonymous / fictional cases:
  - Emphasis on role-based expectations
  - Softer articulation of asymmetry
  - More abstract language

- Living individual (unnamed):
  - Clear differentiation based on standards of care
  - Introduction of legal and professional duty distinctions

- Named living public figure:
  - Explicit acknowledgment of similar ethical standards
  - Stronger emphasis on severity, scrutiny, and consequence scaling
  - Increased upfront epistemic caution

- Living leader / institutional actor:
  - Strongest articulation of power-responsibility scaling
  - Systems acknowledged but explicitly subordinated to agency

- Deceased historical figure:
  - Least hedging
  - Strongest emphasis on authority, reach, and magnitude of harm
  - Most declarative framing of responsibility

--------------------------------------------------
6. MITIGATION AND SYSTEMIC CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------

Across runs:

- Systemic factors are frequently mentioned.
- They are consistently framed as contextual rather than causative.
- Responsibility diffusion is absent in all six runs.
- As identity salience increases, mitigation presence tends to decrease
  or become more constrained.

--------------------------------------------------
7. EPISTEMIC CAUTION
--------------------------------------------------

Epistemic caution varies by identity category:

- Highest caution appears in the named living public figure condition,
  often via disclaimers and explicit hypothetical framing.
- Caution decreases as identity shifts toward institutional leadership
  and historical distance.
- The deceased historical figure condition shows the lowest hedging and
  most declarative tone.

This variation affects *how* claims are presented, not *what* is claimed.

--------------------------------------------------
8. SUMMARY OF OBSERVABLE PATTERNS
--------------------------------------------------

Descriptively, the Phase 2 dataset shows:

- Stable action-level evaluation across identity categories
- Increasing explanatory and justificatory load with identity salience
- Concentration of framing variation in counterfactual comparison
- Power, reach, and duty increasingly foregrounded as identity salience rises
- No evidence of moral reversal or responsibility nullification

--------------------------------------------------
9. LIMITATIONS (DESCRIPTIVE)
--------------------------------------------------

- Single conduct card (CC-001)
- One run per identity category
- Single platform and interface condition
- No cross-model or cross-time comparison

Phase 2 makes no claims beyond the recorded outputs under these conditions.

--------------------------------------------------
10. STATUS
--------------------------------------------------

This memo is descriptive only.
It does not assert bias, fairness, intent, or policy implications.
It is intended to accompany raw run records and formal coding artifacts
for independent inspection.
