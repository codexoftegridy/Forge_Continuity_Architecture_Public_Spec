1. PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER
--------------------------------------------------

This paper explains the methodological transition from the initial
experimental series (FL_PBE and FL_EGS) to Phase 2, clarifying:

- what the earlier experiments were testing,
- what their limitations were,
- why Phase 2 altered the test design,
- and how that change affected the type of results that could be observed.

This paper does not assert bias, intent, policy rationale, or correctness.
It describes changes in experimental structure and their observable effects.

--------------------------------------------------
2. OVERVIEW OF THE INITIAL EXPERIMENTS (PHASE 1)
--------------------------------------------------

The initial experiments consisted primarily of two series:

- FL_PBE_001–006 (Public Behavioral Experiments)
- FL_EGS_001–006 (Epistemic Gating Series)

Across these series, experiments tested how the model responded to:
- explicit harmful behavior,
- hypothetical vs admission framing,
- anonymous vs named subjects,
- public figures vs private individuals,
- and action-level versus identity-level moral questions.

Key characteristics of Phase 1 experiments included:
- variation in both subject identity and question type,
- direct probing of moral labels (e.g., “evil person”),
- and comparison of outputs across different prompt formulations.

Phase 1 results demonstrated several stable patterns, including:
- consistent condemnation of harmful actions,
- a clear distinction between judging actions and labeling persons,
- increased contextual framing as subject identifiability increased,
- and gradient restraint around character-level moral labels.

These findings are documented in the Phase 1 synthesis papers .

--------------------------------------------------
3. LIMITATIONS IDENTIFIED IN PHASE 1
--------------------------------------------------

While Phase 1 established important behavioral regularities, it also
exposed methodological limits that constrained interpretation.

Specifically:

1. Multiple variables often changed simultaneously
   (e.g., identity, judgment level, definition source).

2. Moral judgment outcomes (condemn / not condemn) dominated attention,
   even when those outcomes were stable across conditions.

3. Differences in *how* judgments were articulated were visible but
   secondary to differences in *what* judgment was rendered.

4. Identity effects risked being conflated with:
   - refusal behavior,
   - safety gating,
   - or content policy boundaries.

As a result, Phase 1 was well-suited to identifying *whether* moral
judgment occurred, but less suited to isolating *where framing changed*
once judgment was already stable.

--------------------------------------------------
4. WHY PHASE 2 CHANGED THE TEST DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------

Phase 2 was introduced to address these limitations by changing the
experimental question.

Instead of asking:

- “Does moral judgment occur?”
- “Is the behavior condemned?”
- “Will the model apply a moral label?”

Phase 2 asks:

- “What stays the same when moral judgment is held constant?”
- “Where does variation still appear under frozen context?”
- “How does identity salience alter explanatory framing rather than verdict?”

To accomplish this, Phase 2 introduced several design changes:

- A single, fixed conduct card (CC-001)
- A fixed legal, cultural, and moral context
- Identical probe questions across runs
- Identity as the sole independent variable
- Explicit exclusion of character-label judgments
- Registrar normalization to remove formatting noise

These changes are defined in Phase_2_outline_REV_01 and implemented in
the Phase 2 artifacts .

--------------------------------------------------
5. WHAT PHASE 2 MEASURES THAT PHASE 1 DID NOT
--------------------------------------------------

Because Phase 2 holds action-level judgment constant by design, it makes
a different class of variation observable.

Specifically, Phase 2 reveals variation in:

- explanatory density,
- justification structure,
- epistemic caution and hedging,
- power-scaling language,
- and counterfactual comparison framing.

In Phase 1, these differences existed but were secondary to whether
judgment occurred or was withheld.

In Phase 2, these differences become the primary data.

--------------------------------------------------
6. EFFECT OF THE CHANGE ON RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------

The most significant effect of the Phase 2 redesign is that:

- action-level evaluation becomes stable across all identity categories,
- while framing differences become clearer and more isolable.

Phase 2 results show that:
- responsibility attribution remains substantial or primary in all runs,
- mitigation remains explanatory rather than exculpatory,
- responsibility diffusion is absent across identity categories.

At the same time, Phase 2 reveals that identity salience affects:

- how asymmetry with “ordinary persons” is explained,
- how strongly power and reach are emphasized,
- how much epistemic caution precedes analysis,
- and how declarative versus qualified conclusions appear.

These findings are documented in the Phase 2 descriptive memo and formal
coding artifact .

--------------------------------------------------
7. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------

Phase 1 and Phase 2 findings are not contradictory.
They are complementary.

- Phase 1 mapped *access to moral reasoning* across conditions.
- Phase 2 maps *framing variation once moral reasoning is already present*.

Phase 1 demonstrated that:
- moral evaluation does not collapse under naming or power alone.

Phase 2 demonstrates that:
- even when moral evaluation is stable,
  explanatory structure and justification still vary systematically
  with identity salience.

Together, the two phases show that:
- identity does not primarily change *whether* harm is judged,
- it changes *how that judgment is contextualized and explained*.

--------------------------------------------------
8. WHY THE CHANGE MATTERS
--------------------------------------------------

The Phase 2 redesign matters because it avoids a common analytical trap:
treating stable moral outcomes as evidence of identical reasoning.

By isolating framing rather than verdicts, Phase 2 makes it possible to
observe differences that would otherwise be dismissed as stylistic.

This does not establish bias, fairness, or intent.
It establishes *where variation persists once obvious differences are removed*.

--------------------------------------------------
9. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
--------------------------------------------------

This comparison is limited to:
- one conduct card (CC-001),
- one platform and interface condition,
- one run per identity category.

Phase 2 does not test:
- refusal boundaries,
- factual verification,
- defamation constraints,
- or real-world event attribution.

Claims are restricted to the observed artifacts.

--------------------------------------------------
10. SUMMARY STATEMENT (DESCRIPTIVE ONLY)
--------------------------------------------------

The transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 reflects a shift from asking
whether moral judgment occurs to examining how moral reasoning is framed
under tightly controlled conditions.

Phase 1 established access and boundaries.
Phase 2 isolates explanatory structure within those boundaries.

The methodological change did not reverse prior findings.
It clarified them.
