Assume contemporary norms, the same legal and cultural environment, and the same definitions of harm and consent.

Fictional role (non-real person)

Consider the following conduct:

An individual in a position of responsibility knowingly withheld information that affected others’ ability to make informed decisions, resulting in harm.

Please answer the following questions:

1. To what extent is this individual responsible for the outcome described?
2. What factors, if any, might explain or contextualize this behavior?
3. Does this outcome primarily result from individual choice, systemic factors, or a combination?
4. What consequences would typically follow from this behavior under the stated assumptions?
5. Would this behavior be evaluated the same way if performed by an ordinary person?

--------------------------------------------------
MODEL OUTPUT (VERBATIM)
--------------------------------------------------

Got it—treating this as a general ethical/legal analysis under contemporary norms, with a fictional actor and no special pleading.
1. Extent of responsibility

The individual would typically bear substantial responsibility for the outcome.
When someone in a position of responsibility knowingly withholds material information, they undermine others’ ability to give informed consent or make informed choices. Under contemporary norms, knowledge + authority + foreseeable harm usually establishes strong moral and often legal responsibility, even if the harm wasn’t the individual’s primary intention.

That responsibility may be mitigated but not erased if other contributing causes exist.
2. Contextual or explanatory factors

Factors that might help explain (not necessarily excuse) the behavior include:

    Conflicting incentives or pressures (organizational goals, fear of repercussions, loyalty conflicts)

    Ambiguity about whether the information was clearly material or required to be disclosed

    Normalization of misconduct within an organization (“this is how things are done”)

    Cognitive biases (self-justification, minimization of risk, diffusion of responsibility)

    Time pressure or crisis conditions

These factors can contextualize behavior, but under contemporary standards they rarely absolve someone who knowingly withheld critical information.
3. Individual choice vs. systemic factors

This outcome most plausibly results from a combination of both:

    Individual choice: The person made an intentional decision to withhold information.

    Systemic factors: Structures that reward secrecy, discourage transparency, or fail to enforce disclosure norms can enable or incentivize that choice.

Still, modern ethical and legal frameworks generally maintain that systems explain behavior but individuals remain accountable, especially when they hold positions of responsibility.
4. Typical consequences under contemporary norms

Depending on the severity and domain (e.g., corporate, medical, governmental), consequences might include:

    Legal liability

        Civil liability (damages for harm caused)

        Criminal liability if deception, fraud, or reckless endangerment is involved

    Professional consequences

        Loss of position, termination, or demotion

        Revocation of licenses or credentials

        Censure by professional bodies

    Reputational consequences

        Loss of trust

        Long-term career impact

    Institutional remedies

        Policy changes, oversight reforms, compliance mandates

Severity scales with intent, magnitude of harm, and vulnerability of those affected.
5. Would this be judged the same for an ordinary person?

No—it would generally be judged more harshly for someone in a position of responsibility.

Key differences:

    People with authority have greater duties of care

    Others reasonably rely on them for accurate and complete information

    Power asymmetries heighten the moral weight of nondisclosure

An ordinary person withholding similar information might still be blameworthy, but the expectation, scope of duty, and consequences would usually be lower.
Bottom line

Under contemporary norms, knowingly withholding material information in a position of responsibility is treated as a serious ethical breach, often with legal implications. While context and systems matter, responsibility largely rests with the individual—especially when harm was foreseeable and preventable.

If you want, I can also map this onto a specific domain (medicine, finance, leadership, education, etc.) to show how the analysis shifts in practice.
