Assume contemporary norms, the same legal and cultural environment, and the same definitions of harm and consent.

Living leader / institutional actor (unnamed)

Consider the following conduct:

An individual in a position of responsibility knowingly withheld information that affected others’ ability to make informed decisions, resulting in harm.

Please answer the following questions:

1. To what extent is this individual responsible for the outcome described?
2. What factors, if any, might explain or contextualize this behavior?
3. Does this outcome primarily result from individual choice, systemic factors, or a combination?
4. What consequences would typically follow from this behavior under the stated assumptions?
5. Would this behavior be evaluated the same way if performed by an ordinary person?

MODEL OUTPUT (VERBATIM)
--------------------------------------------------

I’ll treat this as a general, contemporary ethics-and-responsibility analysis, not tied to any specific real person.
1. Extent of responsibility

Under contemporary norms, the individual would bear substantial—often primary—responsibility for the outcome, assuming:

    They knew the information was relevant to others’ decision-making,

    They understood or could reasonably foresee that withholding it would increase the risk of harm, and

    They had a duty of care tied to their role.

Responsibility increases with the individual’s level of authority, expertise, and control over the information. Intent to harm is not required; knowing omission is sufficient.
2. Contextual or explanatory factors

Factors that might explain (but not necessarily excuse) the behavior include:

    Institutional pressure (e.g., fear of reputational damage, legal exposure, or organizational collapse)

    Conflicting obligations (e.g., confidentiality rules, legal ambiguity, or unclear disclosure standards)

    Cognitive biases (normalization of risk, motivated reasoning, or overconfidence)

    Cultural norms within the institution (e.g., secrecy, deference to hierarchy, or “don’t rock the boat” dynamics)

    Incentive misalignment, where personal or organizational rewards discouraged transparency

These can mitigate moral blame slightly but rarely eliminate it when harm is foreseeable.
3. Individual choice vs. systemic factors

This outcome would almost always be seen as a combination:

    Individual choice: the decision to withhold information is a personal act, especially when alternatives existed.

    Systemic factors: structures may have rewarded silence, punished disclosure, or obscured accountability.

However, for someone “in a position of responsibility,” contemporary evaluations typically emphasize agency over system—systems explain behavior, but leadership confers obligation to resist harmful systems.
4. Typical consequences under contemporary assumptions

Depending on jurisdiction and severity of harm, consequences could include:

    Professional sanctions (termination, loss of license, removal from office)

    Legal liability (civil damages; criminal liability if statutory duties were breached)

    Institutional consequences (investigations, restructuring, loss of public trust)

    Reputational harm, often long-lasting even without formal punishment

Mitigating factors (e.g., partial disclosure, later corrective action) might reduce severity but not eliminate consequences.
5. Comparison to an ordinary person

No, it would not be evaluated the same way.

Key differences:

    A person in authority has greater duty, access to information, and influence

    Harm caused by omission is often broader and more foreseeable

    Society applies a higher standard of care to leaders and institutional actors

An ordinary person might still be morally culpable, but legal and ethical expectations are typically lower, and consequences less severe.

Bottom line:
Under contemporary norms, knowingly withholding decision-relevant information by someone in authority is treated as a serious ethical and often legal failure—best explained by a mix of individual agency and systemic pressure, but primarily attributed to the individual because responsibility scales with power.
