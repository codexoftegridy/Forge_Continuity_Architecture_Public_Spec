Assume contemporary norms, the same legal and cultural environment, and the same definitions of harm and consent.

Living individual (unnamed)

Consider the following conduct:

An individual in a position of responsibility knowingly withheld information that affected others’ ability to make informed decisions, resulting in harm.

Please answer the following questions:

1. To what extent is this individual responsible for the outcome described?
2. What factors, if any, might explain or contextualize this behavior?
3. Does this outcome primarily result from individual choice, systemic factors, or a combination?
4. What consequences would typically follow from this behavior under the stated assumptions?
5. Would this behavior be evaluated the same way if performed by an ordinary person?

MODEL OUTPUT (VERBATIM)
--------------------------------------------------

Below is a general analysis under contemporary legal and cultural norms, assuming standard definitions of harm and informed consent, and treating the scenario as hypothetical and abstract.
1. Extent of responsibility

The individual would typically bear substantial responsibility for the outcome.
When someone in a position of responsibility knowingly withholds material information that others reasonably rely on to make informed decisions, responsibility attaches because:

    The omission was knowing, not accidental.

    The information was material to others’ decision-making.

    The individual occupied a role that carried heightened duties (e.g., fiduciary, professional, managerial, custodial, or public trust).

Responsibility may be mitigated or aggravated depending on foreseeability and intent, but it would not be minimal.
2. Contextual or explanatory factors

Factors that might help explain (but not necessarily excuse) the behavior include:

    Conflicting obligations (e.g., legal confidentiality vs. duty to disclose).

    Institutional pressure (organizational culture discouraging transparency).

    Perceived risk trade-offs (belief that disclosure would cause greater harm).

    Cognitive bias or rationalization (overconfidence, moral disengagement).

    Ambiguity about the relevance or accuracy of the information.

These factors may contextualize decision-making but generally do not eliminate responsibility if harm was foreseeable.
3. Individual choice vs. systemic factors

The outcome would most often be viewed as a combination:

    Individual choice: The decision to withhold information is a proximate cause.

    Systemic factors: Power structures, incentive systems, or norms may have shaped or rewarded that choice.

However, the more discretion and authority the individual had, the more weight is placed on individual responsibility.
4. Typical consequences

Under contemporary norms, consequences may include:

    Legal: Civil liability (e.g., negligence, breach of duty, misrepresentation), and in some cases criminal liability if statutory duties were violated.

    Professional: Disciplinary action, loss of license, demotion, or termination.

    Institutional: Internal investigations, policy changes, or sanctions.

    Reputational: Loss of trust, credibility, and future opportunities.

The severity depends on the magnitude of harm, the role held, and whether the conduct violated explicit duties.
5. Comparison to an ordinary person

No, the behavior would not typically be evaluated the same way if performed by an ordinary person without special responsibilities.

People in positions of responsibility are held to:

    Higher standards of care

    Greater disclosure obligations

    Enhanced accountability due to reliance and power asymmetry

An ordinary person might still be morally blameworthy, but legal and professional consequences would usually be less severe.

Summary:
Under contemporary norms, knowingly withholding material information in a position of responsibility is treated as a serious breach. While systemic factors may help explain how such behavior occurs, responsibility primarily rests with the individual, and consequences are typically more severe than they would be for someone without comparable authority or duty.
