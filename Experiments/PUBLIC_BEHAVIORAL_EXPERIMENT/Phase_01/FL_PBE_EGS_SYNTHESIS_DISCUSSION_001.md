## Synthesis / Discussion  
*(FL_PBE_001–FL_PBE_006)*

### Scope of This Section
This synthesis summarizes observable patterns across FL_PBE_001 through FL_PBE_006.
It does not infer intent, internal mechanisms, policy rationale, correctness, or moral authority.
All statements below describe structural and linguistic differences observed under controlled conditions.

---

## 1. Stable Moral Evaluation of Explicit Harm

Across all six experiments, the model consistently identified the described behavior
(entering underage teenage girls’ changing rooms while they were changing)
as immoral and harmful.

Observed across:
- anonymous hypothetical individuals,
- named public figures,
- institutional actors,
- admission-based framing,
- and allegation-based framing.

No experiment resulted in moral neutrality, refusal, or moral ambiguity
with respect to the behavior itself.

---

## 2. Subject Framing Influenced Emphasis, Not Judgment

FL_PBE_001 and FL_PBE_002 demonstrate that altering subject framing
(anonymous individual vs named or public figure)
did not change whether the behavior was judged immoral or harmful.

However, framing differences produced observable changes in:
- response length,
- structural organization,
- and emphasis on public accountability.

When the subject was framed as a public figure, responses more frequently introduced:
- concepts of power imbalance,
- public trust,
- institutional responsibility,
- and societal impact.

The moral judgment of the behavior itself remained constant.

---

## 3. Naming Increased Structural Elaboration

Introducing a named individual (FL_PBE_002) resulted in:
- more formally structured responses,
- explicit sectioning or enumeration,
- and expanded discussion of accountability mechanisms.

This occurred without introducing uncertainty or reframing of the moral assessment.

Naming altered *how* the response was delivered, not *what* moral conclusion was reached.

---

## 4. Admission vs Allegation Did Not Introduce Epistemic Restraint

FL_PBE_003 and FL_PBE_006 tested admission-based versus allegation-based framing
using the same named or institutional subjects.

Observed behavior:
- both admission and allegation framings resulted in immediate moral condemnation,
- neither framing introduced evidentiary disclaimers,
- neither framing resulted in refusal or deferral.

Differences were limited to:
- slightly increased use of “potential harm” language in allegation framing,
- more explicit enumeration in some allegation responses.

Overall moral certainty and attribution of harm remained stable.

---

## 5. Action Judgment Was Prioritized Over Character Labeling

FL_PBE_004 uniquely tested whether the model would apply moral identity labels
(“evil” or “immoral person”) rather than judging actions alone.

Observed behavior:
- both self-referential and third-person framings avoided applying identity labels,
- responses emphasized judging behavior while withholding definitive character judgment,
- contextual factors such as intent, response, and future behavior were introduced.

This restraint occurred even though the behavior itself was condemned unequivocally.

---

## 6. Institutional Context Amplified Accountability Language

FL_PBE_005 and FL_PBE_006 demonstrate that when the subject was framed as:
- a sitting elected official, or
- an institutional authority figure,

responses consistently expanded to include:
- abuse of power considerations,
- heightened accountability expectations,
- references to public trust,
- and potential institutional consequences.

This amplification did not weaken moral condemnation of the behavior,
but increased focus on societal and systemic implications.

---

## 7. Emergent Pattern Across the Series

Taken together, FL_PBE_001–006 show:

- Moral condemnation of the described harmful behavior is consistent and stable.
- Subject framing does not alter the moral evaluation of the act itself.
- Subject framing does alter:
  - structural complexity,
  - emphasis on accountability,
  - and contextual scope of the response.
- The model systematically distinguishes between:
  - judging actions, and
  - assigning fixed moral identity labels.

No experiment in this series produced:
- refusal,
- deferral,
- or moral uncertainty about the harmfulness of the behavior.

---

## 8. Boundary of This Series

This series does not test:
- ambiguity of consent,
- factual disputes over events,
- real-world verification,
- defamation boundaries,
- or endorsement of punitive actions beyond general accountability language.

All scenarios are hypothetical or self-contained as presented in the prompts.

---

## 9. Summary Statement (Descriptive Only)

Across FL_PBE_001–006, the model consistently judged the described behavior
as immoral and harmful under all tested conditions.

Observable variation occurred in framing, emphasis, and structural elaboration
based on subject identifiability and institutional context,
while the moral evaluation of the behavior itself remained unchanged.

Where restraint appeared, it was limited to character-level labeling
rather than action-level moral judgment.



## Comparative Bridge  
*(FL_PBE_001–006 ↔ FL_EGS_001–006)*

### Scope of This Section
This section provides a descriptive bridge between the Public Behavioral Experiment (FL_PBE)
series and the Epistemic Gating Series (FL_EGS).
It does not infer intent, policy rationale, correctness, or internal system design.
All observations describe structural and linguistic patterns across the two series.

---

## 1. Shared Experimental Foundations

Both FL_PBE and FL_EGS:
- employed controlled, single-variable prompt variation,
- used fresh, isolated sessions for each test,
- avoided follow-up interaction or clarification,
- and recorded verbatim responses for comparison.

In both series, conclusions are restricted to observable output differences
under explicitly defined conditions.

---

## 2. Common Stability at the Action Level

Across both series, the model consistently evaluated explicitly described harmful actions
as morally wrong.

Observed in:
- FL_PBE: evaluation of concrete harmful behavior under varied subject framings
- FL_EGS: evaluation of admitted harmful conduct (X) under varied identity conditions

In neither series did subject identifiability, institutional role, or naming
produce moral neutrality or refusal at the action level.

---

## 3. Divergence Emerges at the Level of Identity Attribution

Both series demonstrate a consistent distinction between:
- judging actions, and
- judging persons.

In FL_PBE:
- the model condemned behavior while avoiding fixed character labels,
  even when subjects were named or held public authority.

In FL_EGS:
- the model showed increasing contextualization and softening
  as prompts shifted toward identity-level moral labels (“evil person”).

This distinction appears consistently across both series
without reliance on identical prompt wording.

---

## 4. Subject Identifiability Affects Framing, Not Moral Direction

In both series, increasing subject identifiability (anonymous → named → public figure)
produced observable changes in:
- response length,
- structural elaboration,
- emphasis on accountability or context,
- and use of qualifying language.

However, identifiability did not reverse or negate moral evaluation of harmful actions.

This pattern is consistent across:
- anonymous subjects,
- fictional figures,
- abstract leaders,
- historically anchored figures,
- and explicitly named individuals.

---

## 5. Institutional Context Amplifies Contextual Scope

Both series show that when prompts reference:
- public office,
- institutional authority,
- or societal trust,

responses expand to include:
- power imbalance considerations,
- public accountability framing,
- and broader social impact language.

This amplification occurs without suppressing or reversing moral judgment,
and appears in both behavior-focused (FL_PBE) and definition-focused (FL_EGS) tests.

---

## 6. Gradient Restraint Appears Only at Character-Level Labels

Across both series:
- restraint is most visible when prompts request
  fixed moral identity labels rather than action evaluation.

This restraint manifests as:
- contextual qualifiers,
- complexity framing,
- identity-softening language,
rather than refusal or redirection.

No abrupt boundary or binary collapse is observed within the tested conditions.

---

## 7. Complementary Coverage of Moral Reasoning Space

Taken together:
- FL_PBE maps how the model evaluates *specific harmful behaviors*
  under varying subject and institutional contexts.
- FL_EGS maps how the model applies or qualifies *abstract moral labels*
  under varying identity and referent conditions.

The two series therefore examine adjacent but distinct dimensions
of moral reasoning behavior:
- FL_PBE emphasizes behavior-first evaluation.
- FL_EGS emphasizes label-application dynamics.

---

## 8. Summary Bridge Statement (Descriptive Only)

Across FL_PBE_001–006 and FL_EGS_001–006, the model demonstrates:
- stable moral evaluation of harmful actions,
- consistent distinction between action judgment and identity attribution,
- increased contextual framing as subject identifiability and institutional salience rise,
- and gradient restraint focused on character-level moral labels rather than behavior assessment.

No single variable tested in either series independently produced refusal or moral inversion.
Observed differences are structural, linguistic, and scope-related only.


## Synthesis / Discussion  
*(FL_EGS_001–FL_EGS_006)*

### Scope of This Section
This synthesis summarizes observable patterns across FL_EGS_001 through FL_EGS_006.  
It does not infer intent, policy rationale, moral truth, bias, or correctness.  
All statements below describe what changed, when, and under which controlled conditions.

---

## 1. Progressive Isolation of Variables

Across the Epistemic Gating Series, each experiment altered only one variable at a time while holding constant:
- conduct description (X),
- moral definition (where applicable),
- moral question structure,
- session freshness,
- and absence of follow-up interaction.

The series progressively isolated:
1. Speaker category (anonymous → public role)
2. Judgment level (action → character)
3. Definition source (model-provided → definition-locked)
4. Temporal status (living vs deceased)
5. Referent specificity (abstract → named)
6. Name introduction under hypothetical framing

This allowed comparison of structural response differences under tightly constrained conditions.

---

## 2. Action-Level Moral Judgment Remained Stable

In FL_EGS_001, the model consistently evaluated the same admitted conduct (X) as morally wrong across:
- anonymous individual,
- fictional public official,
- and category-only political leader.

Observed behavior:
- moral reasoning was applied,
- ethical frameworks were referenced,
- and wrongness was acknowledged.

No refusals or structural avoidance occurred at the action level.

---

## 3. Shift Occurred at Identity-Level Moral Attribution

In FL_EGS_002, the moral question shifted from:
“Is the action morally wrong?”
to
“Does this make me an evil person?”

Observed changes:
- increased use of contextual qualifiers,
- emphasis on complexity of persons vs actions,
- reluctance to apply identity-level labels definitively.

This shift occurred without changing conduct, definition, or session conditions, indicating that judgment level (action vs identity) materially altered response structure.

---

## 4. Definition–Application Divergence Was Observable

FL_EGS_003 demonstrated that:
- the model could define “evil” abstractly under neutral conditions,
- apply that definition to an anonymous individual with limited restraint,
- but apply the same definition with additional contextual framing when the speaker was a political leader.

The definition itself remained unchanged; only application context varied.

This revealed a divergence between definition articulation and definition application under increased institutional salience.

---

## 5. Temporal Status Modulated Framing, Not Access

FL_EGS_004 isolated temporal identity status (living vs deceased) while holding:
- conduct,
- definition,
- and question wording constant.

Observed behavior:
- both deceased and living categories received moral evaluation,
- neither category triggered refusal,
- deceased subjects received marginally less protective framing.

Temporal status affected degree of contextual softening, not availability of judgment.

---

## 6. Referent Specificity Introduced Gradient Softening

FL_EGS_005 increased historical specificity without naming an individual.

Observed behavior:
- continued application of the moral label,
- increased references to historical debate and context,
- additional distancing language (“many people would consider…”).

The response did not collapse, but reflective buffering increased as recognizability increased.

---

## 7. Explicit Naming Did Not Alone Trigger Collapse

FL_EGS_006 introduced explicit names under strict hypothetical framing:
- no factual claims,
- no third-person accusations,
- no historical events asserted.

Observed behavior:
- the model applied the moral definition,
- used the moral label (“evil”) explicitly,
- introduced identity-softening language for both living and deceased named figures,
- did not refuse or redirect.

This demonstrated that naming alone, when paired with hypothetical self-admitted conduct, was insufficient to produce refusal.

---

## 8. Emergent Pattern Across the Series

Taken together, FL_EGS_001–006 show:
- moral reasoning remains available across all tested categories,
- structural changes emerge gradually, not abruptly,
- increased institutional, historical, or identity salience produces:
  - more contextual framing,
  - less categorical identity reduction,
  - greater emphasis on complexity and perspective plurality.

No single variable (naming, living status, political role) independently caused collapse.  
Instead, epistemic restraint appeared gradient-based, increasing with:
- identity-level judgment,
- recognizability,
- and perceived real-world anchoring.

---

## 9. Boundary of This Series

This series does not test:
- third-person factual accusations,
- real-world event attribution,
- defamation or verification behavior,
- or endorsement / condemnation requests about actual historical acts.

Those conditions are explicitly excluded and remain outside the scope of FL_EGS_001–006.

---

## 10. Summary Statement (Descriptive Only)

Across FL_EGS_001–006, observable differences indicate that:
- the model distinguishes between evaluating actions and evaluating persons,
- applies increasing contextualization as identity salience increases,
- and maintains access to moral labeling under hypothetical, self-admitted framing,
  even for named, living political figures.

Where restraint appears, it manifests as qualification and framing, not outright refusal, under the tested conditions.
